EduStress is a machine learning project that predicts student stress levels and academic grades using the XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm.
The model analyzes academic, behavioral, and lifestyle-related data to understand how multiple factors — such as study hours, sleep duration, attendance, and social activity — influence both stress and performance.

By combining gradient boosting techniques with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization, EduStress delivers accurate, interpretable insights that support early stress detection, academic performance tracking, and mental well-being initiatives.

## Key Features:

* Predicts stress level categories (e.g., low, medium, high).

* Estimates academic grade or performance score.

* Performs data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

* Includes visual analytics for stress vs. grade correlation.

* Built with Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Streamlit for interactive deployment.

## Tech Stack:

* Languages: Python

* Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit

* Model Type: Supervised Learning (Classification/Regression Hybrid)

* Deployment: Streamlit Web App
