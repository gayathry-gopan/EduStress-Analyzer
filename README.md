### EduStressX is a machine learning project that predicts student stress levels and academic grades using the XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm.
### The model analyzes academic, behavioral, and lifestyle-related data to understand how multiple factors — such as study hours, sleep duration, attendance, and social activity — influence both stress and performance.

### By combining gradient boosting techniques with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization, EduStressX delivers accurate, interpretable insights that support early stress detection, academic performance tracking, and mental well-being initiatives.
